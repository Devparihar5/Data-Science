Make sure your local copy has a reference to your forked remote repository by running:

```sh
$ git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/Your_Username/DataHunt-Awesome-Data-Projects.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/Your_Username/DataHunt-Awesome-Data-Projects.git (push)
```

### 5. Sync it :recycle:

Keep your local repository up-to-date with the original repository. Periodically update your local repository with these commands:

```sh
# Fetch all remote repositories and delete any deleted remote branches
$ git fetch --all --prune
# Switch to the 'main' branch
$ git checkout main
# Reset your local 'main' branch to match the 'upstream' repository's 'main' branch
$ git reset --hard upstream/main
# Push changes to your forked 'DataHunt' repo
$ git push origin main
```

### 6. Create a New Branch :bangbang:

Before contributing, create a separate branch and keep your 'main' branch clean. Use the following commands to create and switch to a new branch:

```sh
# Create a new branch with the specified name
$ git checkout -b BranchName
```

Make sure to use a branch name that matches the folder you're working on. To switch to the desired branch:

```sh
# Switch to the branch you want to work on
$ git checkout BranchName
```

Add your changes to the branch:

```sh
# Add all files to the branch
$ git add .
```

Commit your changes with a relevant message:

```sh
# Associate a message with the changes you made
$ git commit -m 'Your relevant message here'
```

Push your work to your remote repository:

```sh
# Push your work to your remote repository
$ git push -u origin BranchName
```

## Contribution RulesðŸ“š:

- You can make pull requests that break the rules; we accept them!
- Do NOT add any build steps, e.g., npm install (we want to keep this a simple static site).
- Do NOT remove other content.
- Styling and code can be of any style or quality, as long as it works.
- Try to keep pull requests small to minimize merge conflicts.

*We will do our best to merge as much as possible from everyone. However, time is limited, and merge conflicts can be challenging. Thank you for your contributions!*
